          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>
            Dragon Age Annual is an unofficial, not-for-profit project: a labour
            of love not associated with BioWare or EA. We're just a group of
            fans who want to give back to our community!
          </p>
          <p>
            The Annual is a celebration of all things Thedas created by a
            talented team of fans: artists, writers, and more. Each year, these
            fan creators work together to produce a full-colour calendar with 12
            months, 5 bonus works, cover plus extras, all for the benefit of a
            chosen charity.
          </p>
          <p>
            DAA first began production in 2021 for a 2022 calendar (confusing we
            know) and we are now in our 2025 calendar production period. If you
            did not opt-in to our newsletter during our 2025 Interest Check, you
            can sign-up below. Our newsletters will be sent to let you know when
            applications and pre-orders open. We may also send occasional
            production updates!
          </p>
          <p>
            For even more updates, we encourage you to follow us on tumblr or
            twitter.
