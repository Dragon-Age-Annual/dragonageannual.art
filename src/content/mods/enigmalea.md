I'm a fandom old who's been involved in internet fandom in some shape or form
since right around the time the internet became available for home use in the
ancient days. I took a long break from fandom, but when I finally came back in
earnest around 2019, I threw myself wholeheartedly into the DA fandom.

I'm primarily a writer, but I also love to run projects, events, and
communities. I dabble in coding and graphic design. At any given time I have a
chaotic mass of projects and deadlines happening all at once, but the Annual is
always my favourite. I'm immensely proud of the work we manage to accomplish
each year!
