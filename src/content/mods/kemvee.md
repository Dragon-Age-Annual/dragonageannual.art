I joined the DA fandom in earnest in 2018 when, in a fit of unbridled obsession,
I read just about every single Cullen/Trevelyan fic on AO3. Since then I've
dabbled in writing myself, doodled occasionally and thoroughly immersed myself
in Thedas.

I'm a bit of a serial fundraiser within fandom and have modded multiple Dragon
Age and Hades Zines. However, I thoroughly look forward to the Annual taking
over my kitchen table every year!
