I have loved Dragon Age since Origins was released when I played my first
Surana, but I didn't become an active participant in fandom until 2019 while
desperate for more Solavellan content. From that point on, DA has been my one
true obsession.

I'm mainly an artist who also runs a couple of Dragon Age exchanges and servers.
The Annual is probably the largest project I've taken a leading part in, and I'm
thrilled that we can continue its production. It's always a joy to witness the
amazing creations our contributors put together each year.
