I face-planted into the Dragon Age fandom back in 2021 after my best friend
showed me a PowerPoint about how Solas broke their heart and I haven’t left
since. The community is what keeps me here and I’m thrilled to be part of events
that keep that supportive spirit of creation alive!

I’m a fanfiction writer and avid multishipper with enough OCs and world states
that I need a spreadsheet to keep them organized. Dragon Age Annual is one of my
favorite projects to work on and I'm excited to see what everyone creates!
