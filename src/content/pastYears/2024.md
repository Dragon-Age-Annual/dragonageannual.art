  "The front cover for the Dragon Age Annual 2024: Compendium Pactorum; the
  title is placed in the right front foreground in light purple-grey text and
  the letters have a faded neon-like vibrant purple glow. In the background, a
  dragon facing the right side of the image looms above a large stone featuring
  carvings of animals representing the countries of Thedas, its claw curling
  around it. The rest of the image is cast in vibrant orange, pink, and yellow
  from a rising or setting sun which is positioned behind the dragon, the light
  is reflected in the background on cumulus clouds which add texture to the
  image. In the foreground discarded on the ground as if left from battle there
  is a Templar shield and a mage staff; the mage staff is casing very light
  yellow lightning in the shape of the Circle of Magi symbol. In the midground,
  to the right of the stone, under the dragon's head, and framing the title are
  two red banners - one with the Qun symbol and the other with the Chantry
  symbol."
