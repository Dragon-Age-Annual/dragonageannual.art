  "The cover for the 2023 Dragon Age Annual. The background is a greenish hued
  landscape, featuring an ethereal ghostly griffin. Behind the griffin in
  silhouette are floating nugs. On the right side, overlaying the background is
  a golden cutout of shrubs and branches featuring a halla who's horns blend
  into the branches above. In front of the halla in black text is 'Dragon Age
  Annual 2023' and beneath that in green text is 'Paws & Pauldrons'."
