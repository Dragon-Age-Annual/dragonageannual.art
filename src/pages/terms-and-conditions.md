## Delivery & Shipping

Physical copies of the Calendar will be printed in the EU and shipped from
**Sweden**. The target shipping date for all physical calendars is December
1, 2024.

For US addresses, orders are shipped around middle of November in bulk to our US
mod who then re-ships within the US. The bulk package usually arrives to our US
mod within 2 weeks. Once they are re-shipped—our goal is to do this within 3-5
Business Days (defined as calendar days not including Saturday, Sunday,
[US Federal Holidays](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/federal-holidays/#url=2024))—packages
inside the US _usually_ arrive within 3-5 Business Days; packages to US
territories or APOs do take longer.

Based on standard last shipping dates we would expect the physical copies of the
Calendar to be with everyone before Christmas. **However, this is not
guaranteed.** We cannot offer refunds based on late arrival. (Please see
[Returns & Refunds](/#returns--refunds) for more information.)

For general shipping updates, please follow us on social media!

Digital copies of the Calendar will be available to download from itch.io on
December 16, 2024.

## Printing at Home

We welcome purchasers to print at home or at local printers! Please note that
our calendar pages are A4 (210 x 297 mm) and our zine pages are A5 (210 x 148
mm) which may not be standard sizing, particularly in the US and Canada.

If printing at home, please test a single page first to ensure your printer is
suitably scaled.

## Fees

**Free untracked worldwide shipping is included in all physical orders.** As
with all internationally shipped products, there may be additional customs costs
or taxes.

Dragon Age Annual is not liable for these costs. Please consider any additional
potential local costs as part of your purchase price for affordability.

Paypal takes a small merchant fee for each transaction (up to 3.4% + 0.30 USD,
for more details see
[Paypal's Swedish Merchant Fees](https://www.paypal.com/se/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees)).

<p role="note">The Swedish merchaant fees are available in Swedish only. You will need to use a translator to access the information in other languages.</p>

## Returns & Refunds

Returns will only be accepted through PayPal and only prior to product shipment.
If a refund is requested, we will refund the amount of the purchase _minus_ any
Paypal fees incurred by us.

We do not offer refunds based on "late arrival" of your purchase.

## Cancellation

We reserve the right to cancel your purchase. Reasons for cancellation may
include:

- **failure to provide a valid shipping address.**

  If we have not received an address via itch.io or the address provided cannot
  be validated, we will contact you using the email from your order. If we have
  not received a valid address after 5 Business Days from the day we send the
  email, your order will be cancelled and a full refund (minus Paypal fees) will
  be provided.

- **notification you have filed a Paypal or other fraud claim.**

  If we receive notification you have filed a Paypal or other fraud claim on
  your purchase prior to shipping, you will not be entitled to receive your
  order. Should we be notified you have processed a claim _after_ shipping, you
  may not be entitled to purchase from us in the future and we may choose to
  cancel any future orders.

The above reasons are not exhaustive. Should we exercise the right to cancel
your order, you will be notified via the email provided in your itch.io
purchase.
