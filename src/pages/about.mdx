Dragon Age Annual is an unofficial charity calendar featuring fanworks from
talented, volunteer Dragon Age fans— artists, writers, and more.

DAA is a celebration of all things Thedas; a labor of love from fans who want to
create something positive in their community. Our fan creators work together to
produce a 40 page full-color calendar with covers, 12 months, and 5 bonus works,
all for the benefit of a chosen charity. As the project has expanded, we have
also begun to offer fan-made merchandise, mini zines, activity books, and more,
bringing a new and exciting mix of offerings every year.

DAA first began production in 2021 for a 2022 calendar (confusing we know) and
has continued annually since!

## How It Started

One day in 2021 some friends were having a conversation:

<div class="mx-auto flex flex-col gap-3 w-prose md:max-w-3xl">
<div class="flex items-start gap-2.5">
<div class="flex flex-col w-full max-w-[320px] leading-1.5 p-4 rounded-e-xl rounded-es-xl bg-nord7">
<p class="py-2.5 text-nord0">Imagine if there was a pin-up calendar of Thedas' hottest villains!</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="flex gap-2.5 place-content-end">
<div class="flex flex-col w-full max-w-[320px] leading-1.5 p-4 rounded-s-xl rounded-br-xl bg-nord8">
<p class="py-2.5 text-nord0">Ha ha, yeah who would be crazy enough to do that right…?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

And thus the Dragon Age Annual was born. While we never quite got to the villain
pin-up calendar, we are proud of what the Annual has and continues to achieve.

As you can see, our mod team is small for such a large project, so it can be
challenging for us to identify everything we do with easy titles. It's best to
assume we all do a little of everything to make sure we get the Annual out to
each of you in the highest quality we can!
