          <p>
            Our contributors have completed their brainstorming, developed their
            concepts, and submitted them for final approval. After days of
            agonising over so many fantastic ideas and concepts, we're excited
            to announce that concepts are officially approved and our creative
            team has started their work.
          </p>
          <p>We can't wait to see their progress. ðŸ‘€</p>
          <p>
            We are pleased to announce this year's theme and charity have been
            decided with help from everyone who completed the interest check!
            Thank you for your continued support of DAA.
