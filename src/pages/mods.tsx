              <h1>Meet the Mods</h1>
              <p>One Day in 2021 some friends were having a conversation:</p>
              <p>
                <em>
                  "Imagine if there was a pin-up calendar of Thedas' hottest
                  villains!"
                  <br />
                  "Ha ha, yeah who would be crazy enough to do that rightâ€¦?"
                </em>
              </p>
              <p>
                And thus the Dragon Age Annual was born. While we never quite
                got to the villain pin-up calendar 3 years on, we are proud of
                what the Annual has and continues to achieve.
              </p>
              <p>
                As you can see, our mod team is small for such a large project,
                so it can be challenging for us to identify everything we do
                with easy titles. It's best to assume we all do a little of
                everything to make sure we get the Annual out to each of you in
                the highest quality we can!

                  I joined the DA fandom in earnest in 2018 when, in a fit of
                  unbridled obsession, I read just about every single
                  Cullen/Trevelyan fic on AO3. Since then I've dabbled in
                  writing myself, doodled occasionally and thoroughly immersed
                  myself in Thedas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm a bit of a serial fundraiser within fandom and have modded
                  multiple Dragon Age and Hades Zines. However, I thoroughly
                  look forward to the Annual taking over my kitchen table every
                  year!

                  I have loved Dragon Age since Origins was released when I
                  played my first Surana, but I didn't become an active
                  participant in fandom until 2019 while desperate for more
                  Solavellan content. From that point on, DA has been my one
                  true obsession.
                </p>

                  I'm mainly an artist who also runs a couple of Dragon Age
                  exchanges and servers. The Annual is probably the largest
                  project I've taken a leading part in, and I'm thrilled that we
                  can continue its production. It's always a joy to witness the
                  amazing creations our contributors put together each year.

                  I'm a fandom old who's been involved in internet fandom in
                  some shape or form since right around the time the internet
                  became available for home use in the ancient days. I took a
                  long break from fandom, but when I finally came back in
                  earnest around 2019, I threw myself wholeheartedly into the DA
                  fandom.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm primarily a writer, but I also love to run projects,
                  events, and communities. I dabble in coding and graphic
                  design. At any given time I have a chaotic mass of projects
                  and deadlines happening all at once, but the Annual is always
                  my favourite. I'm immensely proud of the work we manage to
                  accomplish each year!
