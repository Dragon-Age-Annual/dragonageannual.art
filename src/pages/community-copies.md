This year, we're excited to offer community copies of Dragon Age Annual 2025:
Legacies! Read on to learn more, and find out how you could claim a free digital
copy of the calendar.

## What are community copies?

Part of the reason we're all here is because the Dragon Age community has been a
supportive and fun place to celebrate our love for this fandom. Community copies
are free digital versions of the calendar, paid for by donations from other
fans.

## How do I donate a community copy?

When you make your purchase in our itch.io shop, you'll have the option to
donate an amount beyond the cost of the package you're buying for yourself. You
can donate as little as $1 USD toward the community copy pool - every $15 USD
donated equals one community copy.

We also have a community copy social stretch goal - once 10 community copies
have been donated ($150 USD), all purchases will include free printable digital
character sheets for your Dragon Age OCs!

## How do I claim a community copy?

Outside of special promotions and giveaways, available community copies will be
released in batches randomly beginning in January as donation thresholds are
met. They will be offered on a first come, first served basis.

<p role="note">Community Copies are intended to make DAA accessible to fans who might not otherwise get to see these amazing works. If you can afford to purchase a package, we ask that you leave the community copies for those who are not in a position to do so!</p>

## What do I need to claim a community copy?

An [itch.io](http://itch.io) account! Please be aware that itch.io only allows
one purchases per account, so claiming a community copy will prevent you from
purchasing any of our other packages from that same account.
